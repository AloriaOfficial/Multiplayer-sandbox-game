    Multiplayer Survival Sandbox

    Focus on engineering-based building, strategic PvP, and deep-world exploration.

🌍 Setting & Theme

You are a stranded engineer on a ravaged industrial world, now overrun by hostile AI and rival survivors. The surface is dangerous, the underground is untapped—and your creativity is your greatest weapon.
🔧 Core Gameplay Pillars
1. 🛠️ Engineering + Building

    Build fully customized vehicles, drones, and base automation systems.

    Use logic gates, engines, pistons, sensors, AI chips, and power sources.

    All creations obey realistic physics-based systems.

2. 🧟 Survival & Resource Gathering

    Gather scrap, circuitry, biofuel, and rare elements.

    Survive environmental hazards, machine threats, and hostile players.

    Manage hunger, heat, energy, and exposure.

3. 💥 PvP & Base Raiding

    Construct fortified bases with automated defenses and traps.

    Raid using siege bots, tunneling machines, EMP drones, or stealth attacks.

    Combat relies on engineering skill as much as firepower.

4. ⚡ Automation & AI Systems

    Automate farming, crafting, mining, and base defense.

    Program logic-based bots for security, repairs, or labor.

    Integrate renewable energy systems: solar, wind, geothermal.

5. 🚀 Multiplayer Dynamics

    Form or betray tech clans.

    Trade blueprints, resources, or information.

    Server-wide events encourage alliances—or full-scale war.

🧱 NEW FEATURE: Drilling & Subterranean Exploration

(Inspired by Astroneer)
🌀 Drill Parts & Machines

    Build tunneling rigs, mobile drill tanks, and underground miner bots.

    Drill parts include:

        Rotary drill heads (metal tiers)

        Soil movers, ore scanners, stabilizers, cargo haulers

        Cooling systems to manage overheating

🌌 Underground Layer

    A vast subterranean zone rich in resources and secrets:

        Rare ores (scrapite, crystalized circuits)

        Ancient AI bunkers with unique tech

        Lava zones, cave biomes, and buried wreckage

        Hidden vaults and procedurally generated dungeons

⚔️ Strategic Depth

    Tunnel into enemy bases from below for stealth raids.

    Create underground bases immune to surface scanning.

    Collapse mechanics and structural physics add danger to mining.

    Install underground turrets, trapdoors, and hidden exits.

🤖 Drilling Automation

    Program digger bots to:

        Strip mine areas

        Tunnel toward coordinates

        Construct underground shelters or tunnels

    Later-game bots can auto-sort ore, repair tunnels, or patrol underground.

🌍 GeoCore Events

    Random planetary tremors reveal rare underground tech or collapse mines.

    These events trigger server-wide races and conflicts for control.

📈 Progression & Blueprint System

    Unlock new tiers of tech via exploration and reverse-engineering.

    Blueprint stealing: hack enemy devices or salvage their creations.

    Tech paths:

        Surface Warfare

        Automation & Industry

        Subterranean Engineering

        Aerial and Mech Design

🗺️ World Structure

    Surface World: Forests, ruins, factories, enemy zones, weather effects

    Underground World: Resource-rich layers, AI dungeons, secret networks

    Air & Verticality: Flying machines, snipers, orbital threats

🎮 In Summary

Wreckforge fuses the creative engineering of Scrap Mechanic, the gritty survival and raiding of Rust, and the deep exploration and digging mechanics of Astroneer. Whether you're building a battle mech, tunneling under a fortress, or wiring up a fully automated AI farm, the world is yours to shape—or destroy.
